## External App as VB Form Child


</div>

### Description

Of late I have been doing quite a bit of Office automation. I thought it look quite tacky the fact that the Office application loaded outside the main app. The following shows how to make MS Word a child of your VB App. (this will work for any application) This has been place on PSC just for others whom may not know the technique to see how simple it is. Hope you enjoy it and please leave any comments positive or negative.
